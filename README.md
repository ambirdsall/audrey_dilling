# Audrey Dilling

I built this site as a portfolio for my girlfriend (I assume you can figure out who that is).

## Technical Details
It's a small Sinatra app, using the Foundation front-end framework for a simple, responsive, mobile-first layout that doesn't look like every Bootstrap site in the world (nothing wrong with Bootstrap, but it's sort of ubiquitous). I used Feedjira to parse KALW's RSS feed for Audrey's work and the Soundcloud ruby wrapper to grab the IDs of her Soundcloud tracks.

I realize it's silly and redundant to keep both the scss files and their compiled CSS under version control, but because this is deployed through Heroku, files in the .gitignore get left behind.
